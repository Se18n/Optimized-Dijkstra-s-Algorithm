Function DijkstraOptimized(Graph, Source):
    Initialize distance[ ] to âˆž for all vertices
    Set distance[Source] = 0
    Create a Min-Priority Queue PQ
    Insert (0, Source) into PQ

    While PQ is not empty:
        (currentDist, currentNode) = Extract-Min(PQ)

        If currentDist > distance[currentNode]:
            Continue
        
        For each neighbor (nextNode, weight) in Graph[currentNode]:
            newDist = currentDist + weight

            If newDist < distance[nextNode]:
                distance[nextNode] = newDist
                Insert (newDist, nextNode) into PQ

    Return distance[ ]
